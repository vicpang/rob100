# Robotics 101

## env set up
```
    Code are from book "Robotics, Vision and Control: Fundamental Algorithms In MATLAB", install its toolboxes
```

## goal
```
    by walking through the examples, one can have basic understanding of many robotics and vision problems, this hides all the algorithm implementations, providing only the shallow skin. This will help gain intuition and motivation. Details of important algorithms will be discussed in next level.
